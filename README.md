 Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading
 causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality
 worldwide. Early detection is critical in reducing the
 deaths associated with this disease.In recent years,
 significant advancements have been made in colonoscopy
 imaging techniques, such as high-definition colonoscopy,
 narrow-band imaging (NBI), and chromoendoscopy,
 which have greatly improved lesion visualization.

 
 The Colonoscopy GastroCADX system, utilizing the
 HyperKvasir dataset and the ResNet50V2 model, has
 shown promising results in the classification of
 gastroenterological conditions. Achieving an accuracy of
 78%, the model proves to be both reliable and effective.
 Key performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1
 Score, and ROC-AUC, underscore its strong classification
 capabilities. Through detailed visualizations like the
 confusion matrix and ROC curves, we have gained deeper
 insights into the model's performance. These results
 suggest that our system has significant potential for
 integration into clinical practice, enhancing the accuracy
 and efficiency of colonoscopy diagnostics.
